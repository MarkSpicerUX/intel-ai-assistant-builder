### Special Query Types

Special queries are used to “focus” the assistant on specific documents. This can yield better, more accurate results and help the assistant answer more sophisticated questions based on the context of the specified document(s). To use the special queries click the attach file icon (the paperclip icon next to the question entry field).

*\*PRO TIP:* Using small files which only contain information relevant to the topic at hand will yield the best results.

To close “Special query mode” click the “Clear” icon from the list of special queries. Starting a new chat session will also exit special query mode.
